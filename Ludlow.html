        <p class="section-intro">
          The Carpet Cleaning Company provides carpet cleaning across Ludlow and the surrounding area. We help owners,
          tenants and landlords keep carpets fresh, bright and hygienic in all sorts of homes and small commercial spaces.
        </p>

        <div class="rich-text">
          <p>
            Many houses in Ludlow, Clee Hill, Tenbury Wells and Craven Arms see heavy use in living rooms, stairs and
            landings. Mud from walks, pets, children and daily traffic all work their way down into the carpet pile.
            Over time this dulls the colour and flattens the fibres, even when you vacuum regularly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Ludlow carpet cleaning service is designed to deal with that deep soil. Using professional extraction
            equipment, hot solutions and mechanical agitation, we lift out the grit, dust and residues that normal
            vacuuming leaves behind. The result is a cleaner, brighter carpet that feels softer underfoot and lasts longer.
          </p>
          <p>
            As well as family homes we also clean carpets for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rental properties and end of tenancy moves in and around Ludlow</li>
            <li>Holiday lets and serviced apartments that need fast turnaround cleans</li>
            <li>Small offices, salons and studios that want fresh looking floors for clients</li>
            <li>Older cottages and period properties where fibres need careful handling</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Wherever you are based near Ludlow, we bring the same detailed method to each job and aim to leave carpets
            looking as close to new as possible.

    <!-- BENEFITS -->

        <h2 class="section-title">Benefits of professional carpet cleaning in Ludlow</h2>
        <div class="rich-text">
          <p>
            Carpets add warmth and comfort to homes in and around Ludlow. They also work hard, collecting dust, grit,
            pollen and everyday spillages. Over time this can affect how your carpet looks and how healthy the room feels.
          </p>

          <h3>Deep cleaning beyond normal vacuuming</h3>
          <p>
            Routine vacuuming removes loose dust from the surface but cannot reach the compacted soil that sits deeper
            in the pile. Our process combines pre vacuuming, pre treatment, mechanical agitation and hot water extraction
            to remove this deeper contamination. This is especially important in high traffic routes such as lounge
            walkways and stair treads.
          </p>

          <h3>Improved indoor air quality</h3>
          <p>
            Carpets in Ludlow properties act like a filter, catching airborne particles and allergens. When they become
            saturated, every step can release that material back into the room. A proper clean helps to remove the build
            up and support a healthier indoor space, particularly for anyone with dust allergies or asthma.
          </p>

          <h3>Extending carpet life</h3>
          <p>
            Grit and soil that are left in the pile behave like fine sandpaper. Every time you walk across the carpet
            they rub against the fibres and cause wear. Regular professional cleaning helps reduce this abrasion and can
            extend the usable life of your carpet, saving money over replacing it early.
          </p>

          <h3>Stain and odour control</h3>
          <p>
            Spills from drinks, food and pets can leave visible marks and lingering smells. We use appropriate solutions
            to break down staining and neutralise odours, not just cover them with fragrance. This is ideal for homes
            with pets, rental properties and holiday lets around Ludlow that see frequent use.
          </p>

          <h3>Time and effort saved</h3>
          <p>
            Attempting to clean carpets yourself with small hire machines can be time consuming and may leave excess
            moisture or residue in the fibres. By using professional equipment and a set process we carry out the work
            efficiently and leave carpets as dry as possible, so rooms can be back in use quickly.
