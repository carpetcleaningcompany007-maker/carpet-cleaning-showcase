From the 1st point of contact through to completion Paul was highly professional and very clear on pricing. We'd recently moved to a large house whose carpets were good quality but with a variety of unsightly stains. We were amazed at how Paul managed to remove all the incredibly stubborn stains which had seemingly ruined the carpets. We are so delighted with the results and have saved a fortune not having to replace them. Also more sustainable! We highly recommend Paul and what a lovely man he is too!"
